# Scaffold for social media app with Ruby on Rails

## Project Specification

Build a social media app called ‚ÄúStay in touch‚Äù.

### As a guest user:

I want to be able to create account/log in.

I can see only ‚ÄúSign in‚Äù and ‚ÄúSign out‚Äù page.

### As a logged-in user:

I want to be able to see all users list.

I want to be able to see selected user page with their user name and all posts written by them (the most recent posts on the top).

I want to be able to send a friendship invitation.

I want to see a button ‚ÄúInvite to friendship‚Äù next to the name of user who is not my friend yet - on both users‚Äô list and single user page.

I want to be able to see pending friendship invitations sent to me from other users.

I want to be able to accept or reject friendships invitation.

I want to be able to create new posts (text only).

I want to be able to like/dislike posts (but I can like single post only once).

I want to be able to add comments to posts.

I want to be able to see ‚ÄúTimeline‚Äù page with posts (with number of likes and comments) written by me and all my friends (the most recent posts on the top).

Timeline page should be the root page of the app.

### Github Actions

To make sure the linters' checks using Github Actions work properly, you should follow the next steps:

1. On your recently forked repo, enable the GitHub Actions in the Actions tab.
2. Create the `feature/branch` and push.
3. Start working on your milestone as usual.
4. Open a PR from the `feature/branch` when your work is done.

### Usage

```
    rails server
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

### Run tests

```
    rpsec --format documentation
```

> Tests will be added by Microverse students. There are no tests for initial features in order to make sure that students write all tests from scratch.
